/**
 * The <code>ColumnFamilyOutputFormat</code> acts as a Hadoop-specific
 * OutputFormat that allows reduce tasks to store keys (and corresponding binded
 * variable values) as CQL rows (and respective columns) in a given
 * ColumnFamily.

 * <p>
 * As is the case with the
 * {@link org.apache.cassandra.hadoop2.ColumnFamilyInputFormat}, you need to set
 * the prepared statement in your Hadoop job Configuration. The
 * {@link CqlConfigHelper} class, through its
 * {@link ConfigHelper#setOutputPreparedStatement} method, is provided to make
 * this simple. you need to set the Keyspace. The {@link ConfigHelper} class,
 * through its {@link ConfigHelper#setOutputColumnFamily} method, is provided to
 * make this simple.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For the sake of performance, this class employs a lazy write-back caching
 * mechanism, where its record writer prepared statement binded variable values
 * created based on the reduce's inputs (in a task-specific map), and
 * periodically makes the changes official by sending a execution of prepared
 * statement request to Cassandra.
